# weather-forcasting-site-using-ml

This project is a modern and responsive Weather Forecast Web Application. It was built entirely on the frontend using standard web technologies: HTML for the structure, Tailwind CSS for fast and clean styling, and plain JavaScript for all the logic and data handling.
​The main goal was to create a clean, functional application that provides users with quick access to weather information on any device, be it a phone or desktop.
​Key Functionality:
​It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display live, real-time weather data for any searched city (current temperature, wind, humidity).
​The application features dynamic visual effects powered by GSAP. This means the background color and animation change automatically based on the current weather condition (like rain or clear skies) and the time of day (day or night).
​While this uploaded version is primarily the frontend, the code is structured to eventually integrate with a separate backend for ML temperature prediction.
